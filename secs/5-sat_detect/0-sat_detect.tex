\chapter{Catalyst Saturation and Aging Detection}
The catalyst saturation that is inherently considered in the CSTR approach needs to be explicitly included as separate
mode of the system. The present work developed such a model under catalyst saturation which becomes one of the modes of
the complete switched nonlinear model. Following the model development we present the parameter estimation algorithm
that estimates the parameters of the saturated catalyst model using the real-world data whose operating mode is unknown
and has additional uncertainties due to $NO_x$ sensor's cross-sensitivity to ammonia. Finally, we develope a statistical
test for detecting the catalyst aging based on the estimated parameters of the saturated catalyst model. The performance
of the proposed aging detector is demonstrated using both test-cell and real-world truck data.
