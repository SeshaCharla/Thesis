\chapter{Data Characteristics}
A critical criterion for assessing the validity of a developed model or diagnostic algorithm is its performance on real-world data, whether sourced from controlled experiments or operational vehicles. For this study, Cummins supplied both test-cell and truck data. Test-cell data were obtained by operating the test cell using established standard drive cycles. Truck data were collected from four long-haul trucks over a one-day period, first with fresh (degreened) catalysts and later after catalyst aging.

% \subsection{Signal Processing Steps}
The road data was collected from trucks operating in the United States  for two days separated by a few years
(Table~\ref{tab::truck_data_summary}) during which the catalyst has aged based on the existing performance measures. The
data contains measurements of $NO_x$ sensors before and after the catalyst, as well as other required variables
including flow rate, temperature and urea injection rate. The data preporcessing includes,
\begin{enumerate}
        \item removing the rows with missing values,
        \item removing the rows whose operating temperature range is beyond range of $200-300 \,^0C$,
        \item interpolating the missing data if the data breaks are smaller than a minute, and finally,
        \item smooting the data using non-causal chebyshev filter.
\end{enumerate}
The preprocessed data is than partitioned into drive segments with no breaks which correspond to a continuous driving
period from engine start to engine stop.
