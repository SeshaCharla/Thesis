\chapter{Data Characteristics}
A critical criterion for assessing the validity of a developed model or diagnostic algorithm is its performance on real-world data, whether sourced from controlled experiments or operational vehicles. For this study, Cummins supplied both test-cell and truck data. Test-cell data were obtained by operating the test cell using established standard drive cycles. Truck data were collected from four long-haul trucks over a one-day period, first with fresh (degreened) catalysts and later after catalyst aging.
