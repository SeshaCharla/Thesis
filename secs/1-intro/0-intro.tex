\chapter{Introduction}

Diesel engines offer several practical benefits, such as lower operating costs and higher fuel efficiency. However,
alongside these advantages, their combustion process produces emissions including unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which are hazardous to health and the environment. Some of these pollutants
result from incomplete fuel combustion, combustion of engine lubricating oils and other non-hydrocarbon components,
while others are unavoidable byproducts of the combustion process.

To mitigate these pollutants, an aftertreatment system is installed between the engine outlet and the tailpipe. The
diesel engine aftertreatment system comprises several subsystems, each designed to target specific exhaust pollutants.
These subsystems include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC): This component oxidizes unburnt hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. It also converts NO to NO2, adjusting the NO/NO2 ratio from approximately 9:1 to 1:1 to enhance Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) performance \cite{hiremath2015development}.

    \item Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF): This filter removes particulate matter from the exhaust stream. It is positioned downstream of the DOC to utilize the oxidation heat for regeneration.

    \item Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Ammonia Slip Catalysis (ASC) System: This subsystem catalytically reduces nitrogen oxides (NOx) to nitrogen and water vapor.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:exhaust_flow} illustrates the exhaust flow path and sensor locations within the aftertreatment system.
Both SCR and ASC are constructed as cylindrical bricks, with catalyst coated on the inner surfaces of hollow channels.
These channels are densely arranged to form the brick structure. Multiple SCR catalyst bricks are stacked within a metal
canister (Figure~\ref{fig:aftertreatment_system}), with the ASC brick positioned downstream. The placement and flow
distribution of these components are key design variables.

The primary function of the SCR system is to convert engine-out NOx into nitrogen and water using ammonia derived from
urea dosing, which is adsorbed onto the catalyst. Regulation of this catalytic reduction process aims to minimize
ammonia slip in tailpipe exhaust by two approaches. The first approach employs feedback control, adjusting urea dosing
based on NOx concentrations at the SCR inlet and tailpipe. The second approach utilizes Ammonia Slip Catalysis, which
oxidizes excess ammonia at the end of the SCR bed (Figure~\ref{fig:exhaust_scheme}).

\end{figure}
% ============================================================
The NOx reduction capacity of the catalyst diminishes over time due to hydrothermal aging and the accumulation of
contaminants, including excess urea, platinum, sulfur, and phosphorus \cite{matsumoto2016model}. While a robust
urea-dosing controller may attempt to offset catalyst degradation
\cite{chen2016estimation},\cite{herman2010diagnostic},\cite{hu2018failure} by increasing urea dosing, this strategy can
accelerate aging and further elevate NOx and ammonia emissions. This has severe environmental and financial
implications. Cummins Inc. had to recall 500,000 medium and heavy-duty trucks in 2018 due to faster SCR catalyst
degradation, resulting in excessive NOx emissions \cite{jain2023model}. On-board diagnosis (OBD) of SCR catalyst aging
under real-world conditions would help meet increasingly stringent regulations. Some real-world limitations include the
unavailability of ammonia sensors, the unobservability of catalyst state, and NOx sensor cross-sensitivity to ammonia.

\noindent Accordingly, the principal contributions of this research are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Development of a new discrete nonlinear switching model that describes the temporal evolution of sensor signals based on control volume and molar conservation principles.

    \item Transformation of the developed model into an identifiable framework for NOx reduction dynamics. Development of a novel parameter estimation algorithm for the switched nonlinear model. Validation of the model using test-cell data.

    \item Identification of parameters sensitive to aging within the nonlinear model. Development of a parameter estimation-based detector using statistical hypothesis testing for the saturated catalyst dynamic model. Validation of detector performance using both test-cell and real-world truck data.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Approach and Thesis Outline}
This research conceptualizes catalyst aging detection as a parameter estimation-based hypothesis testing problem,
employing the NOx reduction dynamics of the system. This framework leads to several sub-problems, which are addressed in
the subsequent chapters:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Chapter 2 analyzes the limitations of sensor data and characterizes the associated noise.

    \item Chapters 3 and 4 present the development of a dynamic model for NOx reduction in the SCR-ASC system, with parameters that are both identifiable and validatable using experimental data.

    \item Chapter 5 identifies the subset of parameters sensitive to aging, develops estimators and detectors for aging diagnostics, and validates these methods using test-cell and truck data.
\end{enumerate}
The thesis concludes with a summary of contributions, an outline of future work, and a proposal for implementing the developed detector.
