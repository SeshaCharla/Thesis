\begin{acknowledgments}

The author gratefully acknowledges the constant support and guidance provided by the three co-advisors, Prof. Bin Yao, Prof. Richard Voyles, and Prof. Peter H. Meckl. Prof. Voyles is sincerely thanked for providing hardware and lab space, and for his guidance in developing a workable research problem related to the Dexterous Hexrotor, as well as for his help in addressing numerous hardware and software debugging challenges. Prof. Meckl is deeply appreciated for his consistent guidance and inspiration in formulating the research problem on SCR--ASC modelling and diagnostics, and for his generous support through Research Assistantships over the past 1.5 years. Finally, the author expresses heartfelt thanks to Prof. Bin Yao for his training and advising in control theory and for his constant encouragement and insight in bringing these research efforts together under a unified framework.

The author would also like to thank the members of the thesis committee---Prof. Bin Yao, Prof. Peter H. Meckl, Prof. Richard Voyles, and Prof. George Chiu---for their time, feedback, and invaluable suggestions that strengthened the quality and clarity of this work.

Special thanks are due to Cummins Inc. for providing the data and sponsorship that made the SCR--ASC studies possible. The author is particularly grateful to David Schmidt for detailed discussions on SCR--ASC system architectures, testing procedures, and truck data conditions, which greatly helped in shaping the modelling and diagnostic approaches. Additional thanks go to Adam Kidd, Larry Brunner, Tom Nelson, and Lyle Kocher for their support, insights, and assistance throughout various stages of this collaboration.

The author acknowledges with appreciation the foundational work of Kaushal Kamal Jain, whose earlier contributions laid important groundwork for the present research. Finally, the author extends deep gratitude to friends and family for their unwavering encouragement, patience, and understanding, without which this thesis would not have been possible.
