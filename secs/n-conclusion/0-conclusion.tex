\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

This thesis addressed the problem of diagnosing aging in diesel-engine SCR--ASC aftertreatment systems using only
on-board measurements that are available in long haul truck. The central idea was to treat aging detection as a
parameter estimation-based hypothesis testing problem posed on a physically motivated model of $NO_x$ reduction
dynamics. The resulting framework is non-intrusive, robust to practical limitations such as sensor sampling and $NO_x$
sensor cross-sensitivity, and suitable for real-time implementation on an engine control unit.

The work began by identifying fundamental limitations of conventional CSTR-based models for on-board diagnostics: (i)
causality reversal and loss of physical interpretability when multi-cell models are reduced to a single cell and
linearized, (ii) nonuniqueness of parameter estimation problem due to sum of exponential functions, and (iii) an
inherent mismatch between model assumptions and realistic sampling rates in production sensors. These limitations
motivated the development of a new modelling and estimation framework that respects physical conservation laws while
remaining identifiable from available data. The key motivations and the resulting model aspects are summarized in the
Figure~\ref{fig::problems_solved}.

Building on the developed model, this study proposes a parameter estimation-based hypothesis testing algorithm for
catalyst aging detection, grounded in the hypothesis that parameters linked to catalyst storage capacity vary with
aging. A Wald-test detector is derived within a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework, leveraging its asymptotic
properties. The detector's performance is demonstrated using both test-cell experiments and real-world truck data sets.
